# SmallFilesMapReduce
## Abstract
In this paper, the problem of small files and possible solutions is discussed in the framework of HDFS and object storage. The existing solutions and their limitations are discussed. An algorithm to detect the need of compacting data files and perform the aggregation is proposed, and a prototype code of a SmallFilesMapReduceEngine is reviewed.
